#### Genetic Association Testing Using GENESIS Workflows on Seven Bridges

The purpose of the tutorial \(PDF\) below is to guide users through the steps of running a single variant or multiple variant association test on NHLBI BioData Catalyst powered by Seven Bridges using a particular set of association pipelines: the GENESIS R package pipelines. This tutorial is designed to be a starting point for researchers who have a general understanding of genome-wide association studies. Previous use of R or the GENESIS package is not required.
